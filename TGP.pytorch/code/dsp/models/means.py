## Salimbeni et al
class Identity(gpy.means.Mean):
    '''
       Identity Mean Function:

          m(x) = W*x 

          Note: W is a projection matrix that maps from input_dimension to output_dimension. It could be created inside this class but for the moment we keep it outside.

          IMPORTANT: This mean function works differently from the others (for convenience). This mean function is R^D -> R^D instead of R^D -> R (as it should be). 
                     This means that this function is usefull for multioutput GP. However, to be consistent with how the kernels work, we need to reshape W to perform a
                     batch of dot products. The input X will have shape (Dy,MB,Dx), and this matrix, by design, have shape (Dx,Dy). This means we have to perform a 
                     batch of dot products with the columns of W.

    def __init__(self, W: torch.tensor, num_inputs : int, num_outputs) -> None :
        super(Identity,self).__init__()
        W      = W.t()                            # shape (Dy,Dx). Each row represents the vector that projects X to each output Dy
        W      = W.view(num_outputs,num_inputs,1) # reshape and add 1 dim to perform batched product of dot products 
        W      = W.to(cg.device)
        if torch.__version__ == '1.5.0':
            self.register_buffer('W', W)
        else:
            self.register_buffer('W', W, False)

    def __call__(self,X) -> torch.tensor :
        # X has shape (Dy,MB,Dx)
        # W has shape (Dy,Dx,1)
        # Batched product X@W gives a tensor of shape (Dy,MB,1).
        return torch.bmm(X,self.W)
